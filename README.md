# Ride Collector

Initial project to find roller coaster ride information especially height from websites. Uses[Go Colly](http://go-colly.org/) for screen scraping. Eventually, will include writers such as CSV, Firebase.

## Development 


```
go run main.go
```

## RoadMap

- Proof of concept 
- introduce interface to collect ride info and write
- separate out interface by ride for contributions
- tests are a good thing
- add a writer to csv
- add a writer to firebase
